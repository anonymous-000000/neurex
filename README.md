# Neurex
Neurex is the first neural-network model to automated exception handling recommendation in three tasks for (in)complete code. It is designed to capture the basic insights to overcome key limitations of the state-of-the-art IR approaches. With the learning-based approach, it does not rely on a pre-defined threshold for explicit feature matching.
